# Create Notes From Canvas

## Summary

This Canvas App is designed to handle notes related to an OOB (out-of-the-box) account table. Despite the default Notes table lacking an attachment column, weâ€™ve devised a workaround by creating a custom card with an attachment control.

Key Features:

Users can add, remove, and undo attachments.

Binary data of attached images is captured and stored.

The app supports various document types.
